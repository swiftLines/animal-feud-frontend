Animal Feud is a web application where users can share their thoughts and feelings on all animal related topics. A user can post their opinion on an animal related matter, or a fact about animals that they find interesting, and other users can agree with or refute that user's claims. 

The purpose of the application is to provide a space for some light-hearted debates and for our users to have bit of fun and take a break from the mundane seriousness of the world.
